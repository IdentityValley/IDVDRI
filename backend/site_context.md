Digital Responsibility Index (DRI) — Site Context (brief)

Purpose
- Provide a practical, comparable view of organisations’ digital responsibility maturity across seven DRGs.
- Help evaluators capture consistent evidence and guidance during assessments.

How the evaluation works
- Evaluators select levels per indicator; scores aggregate into DRG scores and an overall score.
- Some indicators accept proof uploads (mock in this prototype) for verification later.

Indicators and DRGs
- Indicators are grouped into DRGs. Each indicator has a question, rationale, scoring logic, and legend.
- DRGs provide higher-level intent; see injected DRG summary when relevant.

Site behavior
- The Feedback Assistant collects page-specific feedback and clarifying questions about the evaluation only.
- It should not answer outside general digital responsibility, this evaluation, or this site.

About Identity Valley
- Identity Valley is a non-profit organisation calling for more Digital Responsibility. We engage thought leaders and decision-makers in academia, policy and industry to promote a value-based future for the digital world through research, solutions, networking and advocacy.
- We strive to shift the question from “What can technology do?” to “What should technology do?”
- Identity Valley is developing the first system of metrics for organisational digital responsibility. By mapping the digital trustworthiness of organisations we empower users, decision-makers and investors to make smarter choices. Our evaluation mechanism – based on Digital Responsibility Goals (DRGs) – will feed into a transparent index that rewards responsible technology practices and drives systemic change.
