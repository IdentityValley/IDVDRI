## DRG 1
Digital Literacy and unrestricted as well as competent access to digital services and infrastructure are prerequisites for the sovereign and self-determined use of digital technologies.

## DRG 2
Cybersecurity protects systems against compromise and manipulation by unauthorized actors and ensures the protection of users and their data – from data collection to data utilization. It is a basic prerequisite for the responsible operation of digital solutions.

## DRG 3
Privacy is part of our human dignity and a prerequisite for digital self-determination. Protection of privacy – with consistent purpose limitation and data minimization – allows users to act confidently in the digital world. Privacy by design and default enable responsible data usage. Users are given control and providers must account for how they protect privacy.

## DRG 4
Non-personal data must also be protected and handled according to its value. At the same time, suitable mechanisms must be defined to make data transferable and applicable between parties. This is the only way to ensure balanced cooperation between different stakeholders in data ecosystems.

## DRG 5
Once data has been collected, it must be processed with the aim of trustworthiness. This is true for simple algorithms as well as for more complex systems up to autonomously acting systems.

## DRG 6
Proactive transparency for users and all other stakeholders is needed. This includes transparency of the principles that underlie digital products, services, and processes, and transparency of the digital solution and its components.

## DRG 7
Especially in the digital space, we must protect our identity and preserve human responsibility. Preserving the multifaceted human identity must be a prerequisite for any digital development. The resulting digital products, services, and processes are human-centered, inclusive, ethically sensitive, and sustainable, maintaining human agency at all times.
